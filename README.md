# Assignment
This is a take-home interview assignment.
Number line, 2 hours
Using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and/or jQuery, create a number line with two draggable points. Similar to the image shown above, the number line should have:
•	A horizontal line with 11 tick marks labeled from -5 to 5.
•	Have two points that are draggable along the horizontal line. The user should not be able to drag the points off of or outside of the horizontal line.
•	The user cannot drag and place the points in between two tick marks. Instead, points will snap to the closest tick mark.
•	Highlight the area between the two points with a bold line.
