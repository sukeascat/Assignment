# This is a take-home interview assignment. 
Using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and/or jQuery, create a number line with two draggable points. Similar to the image shown above, the number line should have:
1. A horizontal line with 11 tick marks labeled from -5 to 5.
2. Have two points that are draggable along the horizontal line. The user should not be able to drag the points off of or outside of the horizontal line.
3. The user cannot drag and place the points in between two tick marks. Instead, points will snap to the closest tick mark.
4. Highlight the area between the two points with a bold line.
